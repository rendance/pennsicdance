<h2>Music</h2>

Please heed the words of Aaron, our fearless bandleader:

I'm looking forward to seeing many of you at Pennsic! There will be lots of opportunities to play for dancers. Some more information:

<ul>

<li>All instruments (period or otherwise) are welcome, so long as they
don't require electric amplification. Modern flutes, acoustic guitars,
etc: totally OK. Theremin players: sorry!

<li>Players at all skill levels are welcome. If you aren't quite at
the level of being able to sight-read the melodies at dance tempos,
there are easy chords, bass lines, drones, etc that you can try.

<li>We will have music available for use in the dance tent. If you want your own music to keep, please print a copy of
the <a href="http://pennsicdance.aands.org/pennsic46/PennsicPile46.pdf">Pennsic 46 Pile</a>
(or <a href="http://pennsicdance.aands.org/pennsic46/PennsicPile46-uncompressed.pdf">uncompressed</a> if you see problems printing.)
If you aren't able to print your own copy, some copies will be available
from the Music Coordinator for $5 (unbound) or $6 (bound) to cover the cost
of copying.

<li>Musicians are welcome and appreciated to play for open dancing and
all scheduled balls except the Thursday, August 10th ball - we have a
band scheduled to play for that night. We are pretty informal - play
as much or as little as you like, and feel free to switch between
playing music and dancing.

<li>In addition to the balls and open dancing, many dance teachers
welcome musicians to play for their classes! Just show up and let the
teacher know you're interested in playing, and be sure to check with
them for the desired tempo and roadmap.

</ul>
