<h2>Musicians and Music</h2>

Greetings to all those inspired to play music for dancing! There are many
opportunities to play music for dancers at Pennsic.
Musicians are needed
and welcome to play most nights at the European Dance Tent in Pennsic
University.
During the day, many dance class teachers also welcome
musicians to play for their classes. Music is provided. All skill levels of
musicians and all acoustic instruments (period or modern) are welcome. Stop
by the European Dance Tent for more information, including a schedule of
activities that welcome dance musicians!<p>
