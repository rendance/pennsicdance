<h2>Dean</h2>

Inshallah, the Dean of Pennsic 49 Dance will be Gregory Blount, no matter
what year it ends up happening.

<h2>Staff</h2>

The Plague has changed everyone's plans, and so the staff this year
is much smaller than normal:

<ul>
<li>Drop Dead: Countess Judith of Northumbria
<li>Music Coordinator: Master Albrecht Catsprey
<li>Web Minister: the aforesaid Gregory Blount
</ul>

We will be recruiting additional staff at Pennsic. Many hands make
light work!<p />

Also, I am looking for a successor as Dean for Pennsic 51. The ideal
candidate will be someone who plays a major role at Pennsic 50.

<h2>Classes</h2>

The <a href="pennsic49/classes.html">list of dance classes for Pennsic 49</a> is now available!
The full class list is available on <a href="http://thing.pennsicuniversity.org">Thing</a>.
The deadline for submitting classes was <b>May 1st</b>, but there are a few open slots
still left, or you can contact Gregory to volunteer as a substitute teacher.
