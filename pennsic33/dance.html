<P>
Greetings from Don Lyev Davidovitch, Coordinator of Western Dance at
Pennsic 33. This Pennsic there will be much in the way of dance classes,
special balls, and of course evening dancing! If you are a musician and are
interested in helping play for evening dancing or the Pennsic Ball, we
would like to send you music in advance. Please send requests to: HL Octavio de Flores


<P><h3>
Common Questions About Pennsic Dance:</h3>

<b><li>Where is it?<br></b>
During the daytime and some evenings, we yet again have the use of a dance
tent with a beautiful parquet floor. The tent is at the southeast end of
the A&S area. Floor assembly is on the first Wednesday, and disassembly is
after classes on the final Friday. All help and especially power drills are
very much appreciated! For evening dance at other times and for
post-midnight open dancing, we are in the barn.
<P>
<b><li>Will the dances be taught?<br></b>
During evening dancing, a variety of dances will be done. Some will have a
walk-through for the dancers, some will just have a quick talk-through (to
remind dancers who might need a refresher), and the more elaborate dances
won't be taught at all. During the balls, including the Pennsic Ball,
almost no dances will be taught. But the dances that are likely to be on
the schedules are taught either in the beginners classes or others during
the day.
<p>
<b><li> When is it?<br></b>
Classes are usually 10am-5pm or so. The Pennsic Ball is tentatively on the
second Tuesday in the barn starting 30 minutes after court ends. Evening
dance starts at 9pm, and runs until about midnight. Any dancers who wish
are welcome to dance in the barn past midnight.
<p>
<b><li> What is the Pennsic Ball? Do I need to have a masque?<br></b>
If you wish to wear a masque, please do so, but you don't need one. It is a
large dance gathering that draws over 200 people. The tentative playlist
for the ball is as follows:
<br>
<i>15c Italian dances: </i>Rostiboli, Petit Riense, Gelosia, Anello, Belfiore,
Lauro <br>
<i>16c Italian dances:</i> Gracca Amoroso, Caccia d'Amore (pinwheel part 4),
Bizzaria d'Amore, Lo Spagnoletto, Laccio, Ballo del Fiore
<br>
<i>16c English:</i> Ly Bens Distonys, Black Alman, Madam Sosilia's Alman<br>
<i>16c French:</i> Pavan to Belle Qui, Galliard (la fatigue), Toss the Duchess
(SCA Branle de l'Official), Horses Branle, Branle Suite
<br>
<i>17c English:</i> Jenny Pluck Pears, Hearts Ease, Rufty Tufty, Hyde Park,
Newcastle, New Boe Peep, Black Nag, Gathering Peasecods
<p>
<b><li> Do I need to bring a partner?<br></b>
No, there are plenty of dancers each evening who would enjoy sharing a dance with someone new, so don't be shy. In period, both men and women were
expected to ask people to dance.

<p>
I look forward to seeing many familiar and new faces on the dance floor
this year!<p>
