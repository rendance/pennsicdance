<h1>A Summary of Dancing at Pennsic 21</h1>

... as remembered by Mistresss Rosina:<p>

People listed as being in charge of 'Music/Dance' were Lord Geoffrey
Chamberlain and Lady Rosamund de Tournai. However, I think Justin du Coeur
was in charge of the ball. On Monday the newspaper had an article by him,
saying that the ball was getting too large and noisy, so there would be no
teaching or calling. He noted that there would be dance classes every day
in the barn (I'm not sure if these were extra ones - I have no record), and
some teaching every evening. And he gave a tentative list of dances for the
ball, being: Bransles = Cassandra, Pinagay, Charlotte, War, Scottish, SCA +
Arbeau's Malteses, Washerwomen's, Pease, Horses, Montarde, Official. Free
Galliard/La Volta, Carolingian Pavan + tourdion, Spanish Pavan, Chestnut,
Gathering Peascods, Heart's Ease, Jenny Pluck Pears, Picking of Sticks,
Rufty Tufty, Upon a Summer's Day, Grimstock, Hyde Park, Parson's Farewell,
Black Nag, Sellenger's Round, Nonesuch, Return of Spring, Mannschaft
Pavan, Hole in the Wall, Earl of Salisbury, Madame Sosilia's, Black Alman,
Casuelle La Nouvelle, Geloxia, Ballo del Fiore, Saltarello 'La Regina'.
