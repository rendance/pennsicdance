<h2>Musicians and Music</h2>

Greetings to all those inspired to play music for dancing! There are
many opportunities to play music for dancers at Pennsic.  Musicians
are needed and welcome to play most nights at the European Dance Tent
in Pennsic University.  During the day, many dance class teachers also
welcome musicians to play for their classes. We will be handing out
printed copies of the sheet music at the War! All skill levels of
musicians and all acoustic instruments (period or modern) are
welcome. Stop by the European Dance Tent for more information,
including a schedule of activities that welcome dance musicians!<p>
