<center>Greetings from Judith, by the Grace of God Countess of the Royal House of Drachenwald!

<p>

<blockquote>
This year I once more have the pleasure of leading activities in honor
of the muse of dance, Terpsichore. There shall be a full range of
classes scheduled in the Dance Pavilion, ranging from absolute
beginner (everyday at 10 am and 3pm - see schedule for details) to
very advanced - there will be something for everyone who wishes to
learn. We will also be offering wide variety of themed night-time
revels in the dance pavilion open to everyone, even to those who do
not wish to dance at all! This year's Grand Ball (in the barn) shall
be a Color Ball, to whit the tinctures red and white (see ball
information for further details), and it shall once more be taking
place on Tuesday of War Week. Even if you have never tried dancing
before, maybe this should be your year - visit the magical atmosphere
of the redecorated Pavilion and give it a whirl!

<h2>Musicians in the Academy</h2>

Dancing is nothing without music, and live music transforms the
experience. For this reason, we need musicians who are willing to
share their time and skills. Lord Aaron, our Musician Wrangler, will
be leading a series of rehearsals for musicians who would like to
practice playing dance music during the day (Sun Aug 7 &amp; Mon Aug 8,
2pm, at the Ampitheater.) We need musicians for nights of open dancing
(see schedule) and for the Pennsic Ball on August 9th. There are also
some teachers (like I) who prefer to teach classes using live
music. If you are interested in providing music for a class, please
contact me so that we can match you up with an appropriate class. We
LOVE musicians!
