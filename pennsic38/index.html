<h2>Welcome!</h2>

<blockquote>
Greetings from Judith, Crown Princess of Drachenwald by the Grace of God!<p>

This year I once more have the pleasure of leading activities in honor
of the muse of dance, Terpsichore. There shall be a full range of
classes scheduled in the Dance Pavilion, ranging from absolute
beginner (everyday at 2pm and 3pm) to very advanced (see class book)
-- there will be something for everyone who wishes to learn! We will
also be offering wide variety of themed night-time revels in the dance
pavilion open to <i>everyone</i>, even to those who do not wish to dance at
all! This year's Grand Ball (in the barn) shall once more be taking
place on Tuesday of War Week. Even if you have never tried dancing
before, maybe this should be your year -- come by the Pavilion and
give it a whirl!

Come one and all to the English Revel in the Dance Tent, on Saturday the
1st of August at 9:00 in the Evening, at which shall be done divers
sorts of Dances that are known in England, to music by Istanpitta.
Besides Dancing, we will, as the Bard says, "have a trifling foolish
Banquet towards". Many of the Dances will have been taught beforehand by
the Master of the Revels, Lord Henry of Maldon.<p>

Sunday, August 2:
The Beginners Ball is your opportunity to explore the joys of dance
available to all.  Please join us at Pennsic on Sunday August 2 at 9 pm, for
a ball that is open to all levels of dancers.  We will dance a lively
assortment of dances from Bransles to English Country to dances from the
Inns of Court to some easy Italian dances.  Is all this meaningless to you?
Don't worry as this is a 'teaching' ball. Beginners more than welcome.
Music will be provided by an open band assembled at Pennsic.  We welcome
musicians to join us in our celebration.  In addition, there will be light
refreshments available.  The refreshments are sponsored by the Barony of Storvik.<p>

Monday August 3: Her Royal Majesty Eridani, the Celestial Queen of Trimaris, invites you
to join together at the River of Stars Ball on Monday Evening at 9pm.
There will be brilliant and comely dancers because you all will be there
in attendance.  Delightful music will accompany as provided by the
finest musicians from across the lands as led by Baron Octavio de
Flores.  Baroness Mairi Celidh, a Laurel in the cooking arts, shall be
tempting us with edible treats during those occasions when we pause to
reflect upon the spectacle rather join the action.  Honorable Lord
Edwardus the Wise will be your dance master for the evening, a man who
will convince you that dancing is the most desirable way to spend your
night.<p>
