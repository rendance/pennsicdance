<h2 style="color:red;">New for Pennsic 51</h2>

We have two new projects for Pennsic 51: matching dance instructors
with musicians and trying out the dance floor in the Middle Eastern
dance tent.
<p>

Matching dance instructors and musicians: The deadline for requesting
a musician to play during your class has passed. There are still
opportunities to play for evening dancing.
<p>

Trying out a new dance floor: We are exploring for a new dance floor
for Pennsic's European dance tent. We invite you to test one of the
floor options in one of 3 classes in the Middle Eastern dance tent
(near Mid-realm Royal and Pennsic Independent).

<h2>Classes</h2>

The list of dance classes for Pennsic 51 is now available! The full
class list is available on Thing. The deadline for submitting classes
was June 1st, but there are a few open slots still left, or you can
contact Patches to volunteer as a substitute teacher. Note that the
classes in the Middle Eastern dance tent are highlighted in
yellow. New this year, we have added columns for the level of the
class (beginner, intermediate, etc.) and a column for the type of
class (16th C Italian, Gresley, English Country, etc.).

<h2>Musicians and Music</h2>

Greetings to all those inspired to play music for dancing! There are
many opportunities at Pennsic. Musicians are needed and are welcomed
to play most nights at the European dance tent in Pennsic University.
As noted above we are going to try to match musicians with dance
instructors. This is completely voluntary. If you would like to play
for a dance class or have live music for your dance class,
<a href="https://forms.gle/EFB6abhf8GmEiPkL9">please fill out this form</a>.
<p>

All skill levels of musicians and all acoustic instruments (period or
modern) are welcome. Please stop by the European dance tent for more
information, including a schedule of activities that welcome dance
musicians!
We will be playing music arrangements from the
<a href="Pennsic-Pile-51-RevA.pdf">Pennsic Pile 51 RevA (2024)</a>.
You might also find
<a href="http://thedancingmaster.net/sca_dance_fakebook.pdf">Aaron's Fakebook</a> useful.
<p>

The balls that are "closed pit" i.e. not a pick-up band are the
evening <i>The Contessa's Red and Gold Ball</i>, and the daytime <i>An Enchanted
Picnic</i>.
