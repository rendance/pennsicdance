<h1 align="center">(European) Dance at Armistice</h1>

Thanks to the Great Pandemic, Pennsic was canceled in 2020 and 2021.
<p>
  
In 2021 the Coopers organized a non-SCA event named "Armistice" at
the same time of year Pennsic would normally happen. Here's what
little I know about it:
<p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://www.cooperslake.com/clchome/eventdetails.php?clceventid=3a1d242a-9dfb-11eb-88ad-10ae3c21f154">The Cooper's event website is here.</a></li>
  <li>You can sign up to teach dance classes during the day.</li>
  <li>Evening dancing, if allowed by state rules, will be in the Town Hall building, which has a concrete floor.</li>
  <li>If you want to lead evening dancing, you should put in a reservation for the Town Hall.</li>
  <li>The Town Hall is an indoor space, as are the class tents. As of now (late May), PA state rules require social distancing and masks.</li>
  <li>It seems likely? that the state's rules will be relaxed by August. The event will require whatever rules then in force to be enforced.</li>
  <li>There will be a new sound system for classes, and if the evening dance band is not big enough to support dancing.</li>
</ol>
