<h1>Pennsic 37 Dance Classes</h1>

This is the list of dance

NOTE! The schedule currently on the Pennsic War website had a LOT of
typoes introduced in the latest version, as does the list printed in
the Pennsic War book. This is the correct schedule; there will be a
ton of corrections published in the newspaper to make that schedule
match this one.
