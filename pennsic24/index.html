<h1>A Summary of Dancing at Pennsic 24</h1>

Pennsic 24 had a formal collection of dance music,
contributed by a variety of SCAdians, and organized by Tibicen.
There was a
<a href="http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/lod/vol3/limited_pennsic.html">Letter of Dance article</a>
written about it.<p>

Details as remembered by Rosina:<p>

Dance was run by Dani.<p>

        The ball was on Friday, run by Filip and Valentine. No teaching.
<p>
        The
first dance was interrupted by the king of somewhere who for some very
strange reason had decided that the masked ball would be the perfect place
to call one of his (non-dancing) fighters on vigil. The poor thing had been
told to dress up nice and accompany Her Maj to the ball, and I remember
thinking that it was odd that such a lot of non-dancers had decided to show
up. (They all left as soon as the shtick was over.) The king called a
dramatic stop in the middle of the dance, and called up the fighter, who
got to be surrounded by a large audience .... of people who mostly didn't
know him from Adam, and could care less. I remember commenting that if I
ever got called up to be made a dance laurel, I wanted them to call a hold
in the middle of the field battle to do it. I was kidding, of course. In
actual fact I couldn't think of a worse place.<p>
        It was decided that the for and against HitW fund raiser was causing too
much bad-feeling, so the musicians said they would do 6 for free, and every
3 more repeats would cost 25$, I believe. They raised @ 75$, and played 18
in total.<p>

<ul>
<li>Set 1 = Horses B (I think that this was an extra, thrown in for the king to
interrupt), Carolingian Pavan + Galliard, Br Suite (Cassandra, Charlotte,
Pinagay, War, Washerwoman's) - here it was 10:15 PM - Gathering Peascods,
Pease B, Official B, Black Nag, Request (Maltese Br, presume SCA version),
Request (John Tallows), Request (Trenchmore)
<li>Set 2 (started 11:30) = HitW, Rufty Tufty, Hearts Ease, Picking of Sticks,
Road to the Isles, Parson's Farewell, Jenny Pluck Pears, Female Saylor,
Request (Sellengers), St Martins
<li>Set 3 = Petit Vriens, Black Alman, Korabushka, Leoncello Vecchio, Posties,
Request (HitW, again), Grimstock, Rostiboli (maybe a request), Horses B,
Request (Female Saylor), Request (not sure), Request (Gelosia) - about 2:30
now
