  <td nowrap> The earliest examples of nalbinding
  (making fabric from string) are often just rows of buttonhole stitch.
  However by AD 256 there are examples of
  using a variant that appears almost indistinguishable from that of cross
  knitting.Thus, nalbinding is
  occasionally called single-needle knitting.  
   There are 3 examples found using this variant in Dura, Syria, of which
  one demonstrates how this variant can differ from that of cross knitting
  though it looks very similar.See the
  various &quot;knit and purl&quot; techniques used to create patterns as in
  the Dura example.Fee includes
  handout and kit with needle, supply of wool yarn, and starting foundation.</td>

  <td nowrap>A combination lecture and
  show-and-tell: a brief history of Chinese medicine as it was, and still is,
  practiced with its influence on medieval European medicine.
  Many of these techniques are still used

  <td nowrap> This workshop covers the basic
  techniques of the period healing art of G-jo acupressure.
  While G-jo acupressure techniques are
  ostensibly safe and effective, common sense is urged in applying these
  techniques because they do effect real change in homeostasis.
  Workshop has 3 sections.
  First class focuses on relieving pain
  symptoms associated with headaches of several common types, including stress,
  sinus and migraine headaches.
