<h1>A Summary of Dancing at Pennsic 25</h1>

Pennsic 25 was the year that we used Phaedria's collection of dance music.<p>

Details as remembered by Rosina and Jessa:<p>

        Company of St Michael had a ball (and helm show), Monday
night, 8 PM, in the barn. It was to be all period. Baroness Jessa d'Avondale
organized it. Dances I have listed were Danse de Cleves,
Saltarello la Regina, Branles (Double, Cassandra, Pinagay, Charlotte),
Galliard, Petit Vriens, Ballo del Fiore, Geloxia, Casuelle. It was short -
not an all evening thing. Most of the fighters attenting did not dance.
Music was provided by the East Kingdom Loud Band.<p>

        In the regular evening dancing I noted that Rostiboli was packed! I think
this was the year it finally took off, with a critical mass of people
present who knew it.<p>
        Thursday night was to be the period ball, but there was a big storm, and
Duke Randal of the Dark of the East got up and announced that the ball was
canceled as the barn was needed as a refugee station. I don't know if this
was an official pronouncement or if he was taking it upon himself to make
the decision. Refugee station usually means a lot of people hanging out in
the barn talking until the rain lets up, anyhow. It wasn't a spectacularly
bad storm, as I recall. Anyhow, I went away, but it turns out lots of
dancing did happen. I heard from one woman, who's name I've forgotten, but
she attended for years with her family, that she had wondered who these
refugees were that they were supposed to be quiet and not waken, so she
looked in the back where there were a few people sleeping, and realized
they were her younger siblings! She wasn't going to not dance for her own
siblings! (Who probably didn't wake anyhow - the ball didn't tend to have
much louder than recorders, and the kids were already used to sleeping at
Pennsic.)<p>
        The ball was Friday, starting with the masque of 'A Dispute Between
Comedy and Tragedy as to which is Greater'. The dances in it, which people
could take part in, but were not taught, were: Gathering Peascods, War B,
Rostiboli, Maiden Lane, Gelosia, Petit Vriens, Hearts Ease, Horses B,
Pavan, Official B.      After that came other dancing, but I do not have the
list for that, only that it included Rostiboli, Gelosia, Petit Vriens, HitW
(18 repeats, each cost 5$), and a random branle suite played by Fehr Dudh
the swarthy dulcian player.<p>

<p class="p1">15th C. Italian Balli for Beginners</p>
<p class="p1">An introduction to dance from Renaissance Italy focusing on basic moves and progressions. (1-3 Sun. Aug 11, Barn) Signore Onorevole Guiseppe Francesco da Borgia</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">15th C. Italian Balli—Repertoire</p>
<p class="p1">This class requires some previous experience in this dance style, as the basics will, at most, only be briefly reviewed. The class will cover 6 to 8 of the less common balli. (1-3 Tues. Aug 13, Barn) Mistress Rosina del Bosco Chiaro</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">15th C. Italian Balli—Style</p>
<p class="p1">This class will go over the steps and teach 4 or 5 dances. It is open to beginners but is more intense than the introductory class. It will focus on style, improvisation, partner interaction and similar topics. (1-3 Mon. Aug 12, Barn) Mistress Rosina del Bosco Chiaro</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Comparative Anatomy of Fossil Dances</p>
<p class="p1">This course will concentrate on how to use the techniques of comparative choreographic analysis to make startling and satisfying discoveries. Participants should bring their open minds and a willingness to accept that the oddest things can be lying right under their noses. An understanding of what a period dance is, might also help but given a willingness to lean we can overcome lapses in knowledge and prior experience. (12-2 Wed. Aug 14, Barn) Master Sion Andreas o Wynedd &amp; Dougal MacFinlay</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">English Country Dances</p>

<p class="p1">Three Original Dances</p>
<p class="p1">This class is a memorial for a dancer that passed away last year, but not before he developed three original dances for the A&amp;S Original Choreography competition for the MK Spring, AS XXX, Crown event.
