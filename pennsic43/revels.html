<h2>SCA Dance History Ball</h2>

Please join us for the SCA Dance History Ball!
<p>

The SCA will soon celebrate 50 years.  Help us remember those years through
our favorite dances.  We'll dance some of the old favorites and learn some
new ones that may become our favorites.  We'll tell some stories between
the sets.  The dance community has come a long way from folk dances to
deciphering period manuscripts.  Join us as we relive some of this history.
<p>
(Please note the 8pm start time - don't be late!)
<P>

<h2>Childrens' Ball</h2>

Dance and be merry!  This is the perfect ball for children, beginners,
and experts wanting to have fun. Dances will have just enough
instruction to keep everyone on the right foot. All youth in
attendance require a responsible adult to be present.

<h2>Dance Games</h2>

Come to an evening filled with games and dance!  Games that are
dances? Dances that are games? Games with dancers? Social, gamified
dances! We'll have all that and more.

of European Dance happen! Light refreshments will be provided and a

Not a dancer?  Or have two left feet?  Then this is the ball for you!
The Beginners' Ball lets you explore the joys of dance without needing
any experience.  This is a teaching ball, meaning every dance will be

need to bring a partner! Music and light refreshments will be
provided.

fun anyone can have in the SCA, but it is an activity anyone can do!
This is the perfect ball for teens and anyone who wants to have
fun. Dances will have enough instruction to get everyone on the dance
floor. Light refreshments will be provided (yes, free food!). Music

Come out and watch the biggest and brightest stars of the SCA compete
in a Renaissance dance competition! Each couple will consist of an

dance experience. Contestants will perform dances from a variety of
genres, competing for judge’s points and audience votes.<p>

Music will be provided by Istanpitta.

It's Musicians VS Dancers, an all out, knock down, drag out fight to the
finish!<p>

it's musician's choice and anything goes as long as it's some form of
"branles" or brawl.<p>
