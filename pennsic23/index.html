<h1>A Summary of Dancing at Pennsic 23</h1>

Details as recalled by Rosina and Jessa:<p>

Dance was organized by Baroness Jessa d'Avondale, who assembled a book
of dance music that musicians could obtain prior to Pennsic.<p>

Evening Dancing:<p>

The "official" evening dancing started on Sunday, August 13, although
plenty of dancing was taking place before that.  Aside from general
"open" evenings, when dances were being taught, there was also a ball
of Popular SCA dances sponsored by Clan Blue Feather on Wednesday
night, and a Masked Ball on Friday night.  For these evenings,
programs of dances were organized and teaching was kept to a minimum.
Many of the dance teachers volunteered to lead the dancing for
specific nights.<p>

Balls:<p>

The ball was on Friday, Aug 19, scheduled for 9:30, but started at 10
PM, because of the Chartres Cathedral set for the Pennsic Choir, which
was very impressive, but we were having problems with people walking
the maze in the middle of the dancing .... It also took up room on the
floor, and the set designer wanted the walls (cloth) left up as they
would make it so pretty, but I wanted them down, because I knew how
hot it was going to get. Ended 12 or 12:15.<p>

        The paper's report of the ball noted that several popular dances were
left off, and 'some that were included, most notably the Italian
Renaissance balli, were known to less than a tenth of the crowd.'<p>
        Another article noted that there had been a HitW for and against
competition, for the second year, as a chirurgeon's fund raiser. It didn't
say which day, but I presume at the ball, and the tally was taken at
midnight, so I think they did it at the end. 69$ in the for jar, against
was 65$, but the musicians donated an extra 10 repeats.<p>

<ul>
<li>Set 1 = Brawls (Cassandra, Pinagay, Charlotte, War, Aridan), Petit Riense,
Jenny Pluck Pears, Black Nag, Picking of Sticks, Geloxia
<li>Set 2 = Saltarello La Regina, Horses B, Black Alman, Montarde, Rufty
Tufty, Hearts Ease, Fine Companions
<li>Set 3 = Carolingian Pavan + Galliard, Gathering Peascods, Sellengers
Round, Official B, Scots B, Madame Sosilia's Alman, Danse de Cleves
</ul>

Blue Feather Ball on Aug 17, Weds, was supposed to be a populist ball,
'SCA favorites'. (It was an actual ball, not a party called a ball.)<p>

<ul>
<li>Set 1 = Queen's Alman, Horses B, Upon a Summer's Day, Black Nag, Official
B, Sellenger's, Maltese
<li>Set 2 = Madame Sosilia's, Gay Gordon, Jenny Pluck Pears, Picking of
Sticks, Montarde, Gathering Peascods.
<li>Then requests, and dancing lasted
till @ 3 AM.
</ul>

Classes:<p>

Classes were scheduled for regular times (11-1 and 2-4 almost every
day), so that even if the dancers didn't remember the exact class
schedule, they would always know the classes times.<p>

The class schedule &amp; teachers:

Sunday PM:    English Country Dance 1 – Julianna d'Antioche, Katriona op den Dijk<p>

</blockquote><p>

Other teachers assisted at these classes, including: Guiseppe di
Borgia, Katriona ni Chonarain, and Berengaria de Montfort of
Carcassonne<p>

Feedback:<p>

The dance teachers met at the end of the week to discuss how the
dancing went, overall.  From notes taken by Dame Cassandra:<p>

<blockquote>
"On the administrative side, having the overall dance coordinator
function as a supervisor and not teach dance class or run the evening
dancing worked quite well.  Keeping things coordinated and running
smoothly is a large enough job without trying to do anything else."<p>

"Also administratively, having dance under the umbrella of the arts
and sciences autocrat helped to facilitate the smooth running of dance
and the coordination between other classes. "
