 <tr> <td> 08-09 <br> 10:00 </td> <td>1.0</td> <td>Dance Tent</td> <td><em>Gresley Dance Manuscript</em>: New Interpretations</td> <td>Lady Catalina D'Isenfir</td> <td>The <em>Gresley Dance Manuscript</em> was written circa 1490, antedating previously discovered written records of English dance. Little is known about the <em>Gresley Dance Manuscript</em> and the text has gone largely unexamined by historians. My study of the manuscript begins by considering the dances themselves through reconstruction of the dance choreographies recorded in the manuscript. I argue that the dances recorded in the <em>Gresley Dance Manuscript</em> are an early example of English dance choreographies which appear to share similarities with European dance forms, similarities which are not identifiable in later English dance choreographies. The Gresley dances share with European dance forms the choreographic elements associated with courtship in continental dance styles. I assert that the Gresley dances may have been recorded in the Gresley Priory, suggesting the presence of complex dance forms which feature choreographic markers of courtship in a monastic setting. This course will be taught in a lecture style and will focus on the conclusion of my research. It accompanies a movement-based class which allows more in-depth experimentation with my reconstructions of the Gresley dances.</td> </tr>

My study of the manuscript began by considering the dances themselves through reconstruction of the dance choreographies recorded in the manuscript. This class focuses on my new reconstructions; participants will learn my proposed reconstructed movements of the dances and perform them. Respectful suggestions, troubleshooting, and comments are welcome! This is a largely movement-based dance class, although the class may periodically pause to discuss the dance reconstructions as we learn them. This class is a movement portion of my class on the <em>Gresley Dance Manuscript</em>. Registration for both parts is <strong>not</strong> required.</td> </tr>

Wear your masks and costumes! Come as a character! <em>Commedia dell' Arte</em> will be in full swing at the Pennsic Grand Ball. Pantalone will announce which lucky suitor will marry his daughter Isabella this evening! So many suitors, yet only one will be chosen. Do you wish to court Isabella? Do you have a suitor you want to be betrothed to Isabella? Wait... which one is Isabella? Who can tell with so many beautiful maidens dancing at the ball? Dances will be a mix of difficulty levels and use music arrangements from the new Pennsic Pile for Pennsic 50. All musicians are welcome and will be given water and foot rubs as needed from Arlecchino (don't tell him we signed him up for this!).</td> </tr>
