<h1>A Summary of Dancing at Pennsic 20</h1>

... as remembered by Mistresss Rosina:<p>

Master Sion Andreas was in charge of dance. He had different people
proctor on different evenings. There was a DMs meeting Mon 7-8 PM
Ball was Fri Aug 16. A Canadian film crew, not in garb, got in the way.
Rostiboli and Il Canario got done as performances during the breaks.
<p>

Classes ran from Mon Aug 12 to Sat Aug 16, 103 were listed in the booklet,
Held in 3 class tents and the bathhouse.<p>
Dance Classes listed:<p>
<ul>
<li>Thu 3-5 = 15th Century Dance, Master Niall McKennett (I believe he taught
Pellegrina)
<li>Sat 9-10:30 = Scottish Dance, Lord Daibhaidh
<li>Sat 1-2 = Basic Arbeau Bransles, Lord Edouard d?Aubigny
</ul>
Dance class not listed, as I added it when I saw how few dance classes
there were:<p>
<ul>
<li>Weds 4-6 = Colonesse + Il Canario, Roswitha (now known as Rosina)
</ul>
