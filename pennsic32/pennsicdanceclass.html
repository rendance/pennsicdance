dance -- and also a series of exercises that students can do to improve <br>
their skill. Learn how to dance on a crowded floor, and glide "like a <br>
gondola." Since the emphasis is on 15th c. Italian dance, a basic <br>
understanding of it and knowing Rostboli Gioioso is helpful but not <br>
necessary for this class. For all levels of experience, but some material <br>
will be fast-paced to the beginners. See also the description for "Dance to <br>

Branles and Pavans: the forgotten genre of French 16th c. dance (aka, <br>
"Arbeau says WHAT?!")<br>
<br>
Many SCA dancers started with these easy dances as beginners, and then <br>
moved on to other genres. I feel that there is plenty in Arbeau to keep <br>
dancers of all skill levels interested. Learn how to do Horse's Branle six <br>
different ways! This class is for everyone from absolute beginner to <br>

Spinning, Leaping, and Lifting: La Volte<br>
<br>
The lavolta, or la volte, is an energetic and dizzy <br>
dance, highly recommended for agile and adventurous dancers. It's also a <br>
good way for a man to pick up a woman. Literally. Thrill your partner, <br>
annoy the moralists, and make a good impression on Queen Elizabeth I of <br>
England. By the way, if any woman wears a busk to this class it should be <br>
well fitted and securely stitched together.<br>
