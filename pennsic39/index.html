the muse of dance, Terpsichore. There shall be a full range of classes
scheduled in the Dance Pavilion, ranging from absolute beginner (everyday at
10 am and 3pm - see schedule for details) to very advanced - there will be  
something for everyone who wishes to learn. We will also be offering wide
variety of themed night-time revels in the dance pavilion open to everyone, 
even to those who do not wish to dance at all! This year's Grand Ball (in
the barn) shall be a Color Ball, to whit the tinctures red and black (see
ball information for further details), and it shall once more be taking
place on Tuesday of War Week. Even if you have never tried dancing before,
maybe this should be your year - visit the magical atmosphere of the
