<p class="p1">A Baletto and Sciolta from Caroso</p>
<p class="p1">Learn to dance Contentezza d’Amore, a balletto and sciota from Caroso’s Il Ballarino book published in 1580. One of Lochac’s most popular dances, so here’s your chance to learn it before the Known World Dance Symposium in 2005! Fairly complex, but low energy level. (8/17/00, 2-3 PM) Delbert von Strassburg</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Assemble for Field Trip to Masked Ball</p>
<p class="p1">See “Children &amp; Youth”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Caroso-Style Ball</p>
<p class="p1">This ball is an attempt to recreate the sort of ball implied by the descriptions in the etiquette sections of Caroso’s “Nobilta’ di Dame”, which is a dance manual published in Italy in 1600. See longer description elsewhere in the booklet. (8/18/00, 2-4 PM) Pennsic Dancemasters</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Contrapasso in a Circle</p>
<p class="p1">This is an easy (yes, really!) 16th-century Italian dance from Caroso’s Nobilita di Dame. It’s for a circle of couples, “as many as will,” and looks a lot like a somewhat-fancy English country dance. Beginners welcome. The steps are all easy, the tempo is moderate, and the music is pretty. (8/16/00, 3-4 PM) Mara Kolarova</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Cruel Parting and Reunion</p>
<p class="p1">An intensive introduction to 15th-century Italian Bassadanza. No previous experience needed. Dances probably include Pazienza, Lauro, Riunione, Partitia Crudele and Coronita Gentile. (8/10/00, 11 AM – 1 PM) Rosina del Bosco Chiaro</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Dances for the Masked Ball</p>
<p class="p1">Come learn a variety of dances that will be played at the Masked Ball. Get ready to amaze your friends (and partners) by knowing everything we’re going to dance! (8/14/00, 2-4 PM; 8/15/00, 2-4 PM) Pennsic Dancemasters</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Fifteenth-Century Dance Workshop</p>
<p class="p1">Focuses on step work, placement and dancer interaction. COME WARMED UP. One dance may be taught, but the goal will not be learning a choreography. No previous 15th-century dance experience needed, but class is not geared toward beginners. (8/11/00, 11-noon) Rosina del Bosco Chiaro</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Fifteenth-Century Italian Dances: Another Tradition</p>
<p class="p1">Two 15th-century Italian dances (Lauro and Leoncello Vecchio), based on reconstructions done by Dr. Ingrid Brainard. The15th-century sources are ambiguous, so various researchers have differing interpretations. These steps look somewhat different from those spreading through the Society in recent years. Beginners welcome. (8/15/00, 1-2 PM) Mara Kolarova</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Foot It Fairly</p>
<p class="p1">Once upon a time there was an innocent, unassuming little dance form we now call the English Country Dance. Eventually it came to the notice of the Queen and her Court. They took it home, fed it up, and added some laces and bows. It became the Darling of the Realm, and the dance world would never the same. We will experiment with those laces and bow, adding Italian ornaments and steps to four country dances that we already know in the “walked” form. (8/14/00, 11 AM – 12:30 PM; 8/18/00, 11 AM – 12:30 PM) Sion Andreas o Wynedd</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Galliards, Galliards, and More Galliards</p>
<p class="p1">A rotating track (through 8/18) of galliard classes, concentrating first on basic galliards, followed by variations, including La Volta (the dance Elizabeth and Dudley did in the movie), Kick-the-tassel, and others. Not very complex; energy level is moderate to high. (8/14/00, 10-11 AM; 8/15/00, 10-11 AM; 8/16/00, 10-11 AM; 8/17/00, 10-11AM; 8/18/00, 10-11 AM) Delbert von Strassburg, co-taught with Nathan Kronenfeld.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Gems Out of Burgundy</p>
<p class="p1">Yeah, yeah, we all know those swanky Italian balli now, but what is that Man-of-the-Hour, Charles the Bold, dancing? Class covers two basse danses of domestic vintage and a ballo stolen from Italian courtiers, artfully reshaped to fit decorous northern modes of dancing: Casuelle Nouvelle, Orleans, and Roti Boully Joyeaulx. (8/13/00, 5-6:30 PM; 8/16/00, 11 AM-12:30 PM) Sion Andreas o Wynedd</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Gracca Amorosa</p>
<p class="p1">Lively (aerobic) 16th-century dance by Caroso, intermediate level. You should be familiar with 16th-century Italian dance steps. (8/12/00, 1-2 PM; 8/17/00, 11-noon) Alina of Foxwood</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">How to Dance Like a Picky Purist: Part 1</p>
<p class="p1">Learn the correct (in the teacher’s humble opinion) way to do selected country dances. Each class includes a little analysis of the Playford instructions. Part I consists of “round dances.” (8/12/00, 10-noon) Henry of Maldon</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">How to Dance Like a Picky Purist: Part 2</p>
<p class="p1">See listing for 8/ 12. This session covers “longways dances.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(8/13/00, 10-noon) Henry of Maldon</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Il Canario/Negri 1602</p>
<p class="p1">A reconstruction of Negri ’s most complicated dance. Not for the faint-hearted; quite long and taxing, but not athletic. (8/13/00, 11 AM – 2 PM) Delbert von Strassburg , co-taught with Lady Mordecaia Maria del Sol</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Introduction to Dance</p>
<p class="p1">European dancing for the beginner. Each session (through 8/18) covers a new set of dances. It doesn’t matter if you’ve never danced before or have two left feet. Topics include English country dance, bransles, pavanes, almains, Italian dance, and anything else our minds can cook up. (8/9/00, 4-5 PM; 8/10/00, 4-5 PM; 8/11/00, 4-5 PM; 8/12/00, 4-5 PM; 8/13/00, 4-5 PM; 8/14/00, 4-5 PM; 8/15/00, 4-5 PM; 8/16/00, 4-5 PM; 8/17/00, 4-5 PM; 8/18/00, 1:00 PM) Pennsic Dancemasters</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Joy and the Wayward Nun</p>
<p class="p1">An intensive introduction to 15th-century Italian Balli. No previous experience needed. Dances probably include Rostiboli, Gioioso, Colonesse, Pizocara, Jupiter and Fiore de Vertu. (8/9/00, 11 AM – 1 PM) Rosina del Bosco Chiaro</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Masked Ball</p>
<p class="p1">“Tygers and Dragons and Bears”. Come as your favorite animal, heraldic or not. Dances will not be taught but you will find many old favorites. Dances will be taught in classes on Monday and Tuesday. Come dance the night away at the Masked Ball! All are welcome, from beginners to dance junkies. Come to the Bam to help us make magic in costume and mask as we dance till we wear out the musicians (or they wear us out!). (8/15/00, 9-midnight) Pennsic Dancemasters</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Tesara I</p>
<p class="p1">Tesara is a 15th-century Italian performance dance. COME WARMED UP, and bring a scarf about 8"x44" if possible. This is the first of three sessions (see 8/12 and 8/ 1 3) and open to beginners. All steps will be taught.
