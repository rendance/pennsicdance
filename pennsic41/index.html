Everything you ever wanted to know about
<h1 align="center">The Pennsic 41 Academy of Dance</h1>
and then some.
</center>
<p>

Unto one and all does Master Lorenzo Petrucci extend greetings and an
invitation to dance at Pennsic!<p>

For all the years I have been attending Pennsic, the thing that has kept me
coming back time and time again is the dancing, and the community that
gathers each year to share their knowledge and spread the joy. There will
be classes all day from the first Wednesday of War through Friday of War
Week, covering everything from the very basics of dance to the most
elaborate choreographies and latest scholarship. Every evening will also
feature festive revels until the late hours, each with a different theme
and dance list.

<h2>Staff List</h2>

It is a great honor to be in charge of dancing this year, but I would not
be able to accomplish anything without my capable staff:

<ul>
<li>Pavilion Floor Coordinator: THL Darius the Dancer and Lady Lynette la Petite
<li>Music Coordinator: Lord Aaron Drummond
<li>Website: Master Gregory Blount
<li>Pennsic Dance Publicity: Lady Lorita
</ul>

<h2>Classes</h2>

We will have classes every day, starting Wednesday, August 1, at 10am.
<p>

See the <a href="classes.html">class list</a> (formerly <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Ah7rAXyK2R-BdDc1VmR0ckZLYTFWaWtocnhCMlZoa3c&single=true&gid=8&output=html">here</a>)

<h2>Musicians at Pennsic</h2>

The War attracts the most puissant warriors, the finest artisans, and
the most elite of nobility. Each year also sees the assembly of the most
talented musicians of the Known World, for which those who dance are ever
grateful. Lord Aaron Drummond is in charge of both sheet music (the
Pennsic Pile) and managing musical personnel this year. He will be
leading rehearsals Aug. 5-7 in the Amphitheater, and hosting a round
table discussion on the contents of the Pennsic Pile during the latter
part of War Week. More details will be posted as they become available.<p>

All musicians are welcome to play in the evenings for open dancing
(during the first week) and for the Beginner's Ball and Grand Ball
during War Week. Many teachers will also welcome live music to accompany
their classes, so if you are interested in assisting please contact me or
the teacher of the class you would like to play for.

meaningless to you? Don't worry as this is a 'teaching' ball. Beginners are more
than welcome. Music will be provided by an open band assembled at Pennsic.

and place. When we are done we will have danced Balli and Bransles,
Cascarde and Country Dances, Basse danses and Galliards, Allemands,
Pavannes and Balletti... all within their own setting of time and
place. We are hoping to provide the most artful melodies from these
