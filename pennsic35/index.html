<h2>Party Announcements</h2>

A Celebration, part Deux<p>

To all right trustworthy and noble gentles to whom these presents come,
greetings.  Let it be known that on Wednesday, the seventeenth day of
August, being the second month of the reign of Michael and Moira, King and
Queen of Drachenwald, there will be a celebration of the most blessed
sacrament of marriage between the honourable lady Judith de Northumbria and
the noble knight Gerhardt von Wuestenburg, count of the court of
Drachenwald.  This celebration will take place in none other than the much
disputed city of Pennsic, in the Dance House of said town, commencing at the
fall of darkness. That none should tire too quickly, the House of
Wuestenburg will offer drink and sundry food and games in addition to the
evening's primary festivity-dance!  The new Lady of the house will entertain
her guests in the time honoured tradition of dance from the courts of the
Medicis, the Sforzas, the Lancasters, and the Hapsburgs (for the
historically confused, fifteenth century dances only).  The minstrels will
endeavor to fulfill the desires of all and sundry, an they know the tune!
