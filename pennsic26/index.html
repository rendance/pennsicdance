<h1>A Summary of Dancing at Pennsic 26</h1>

Pennsic 26 was the first year of the Pennsic Pile of Dance Music.<p>

Details remembered by Rosina:<p>

Midair ran dance.<p>
There was a Caroso ball Weds at 230 PM.<p>

        The ball was held Thursday, supposedly at 9 PM, but Midrealm court only
ended 930.      It started with a masque, 'The Real Muse of Dance', which had
13 dances in it (one for each of the 13 claimants to being the real muse.).
I don't recall if anyone who wanted could participate. I believe they
included: Brawl Suite, Horses B, Petit Vriens, Black Alman, Madame
Sosilia's, Rostiboli, Black Nag', Anello, Parson's Farewell', Sellengers,
Hearts Ease, Road to the Isles done in a cruciform, and one other.<p>

<ul>
<li>Set 1 = Brawl Suite, Gelosia, Jenny Pluck Pears, Carolingian Pavan, Horses
Branle
<li>Set 2 = Gathering Peascods, Montarde, Petit Vriens, Black Alman, Rufty Tufty
<li>Set 3 = Madame Sosilias, Hyde Park, Pease + War B, Rostiboli, All in a
Garden Green
<li>Set 4 = Black Nag, Earl of Salisbury, Anello, Parson's Farewell, Tangle
<li>Set 5 = Sellengers, Ballo del Fiore (done with Filip's flea cards), Hearts
Ease, Amoroso, Juice of Barley.
</ul>

Ball ended @ 130 AM, with more dancing after.
<p>
<p class="p1">Catena d'Amore</p>
<p class="p1">Master Sion introduces dancers to the "Chains of Love", whipping them into shape to face the discipline of 16th-century Italian dance. Catena is an intermediate dance level by Cesare Negri which bears similarities to both Trenchmore &amp; the Tangle Bransle. (Wed. 13, 12:30-2:30 p.m., Barn) Master Sion Andreas</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Dance Roundtable: Encouraging Early Dance</p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Dance Roundtable: Sources and Resources</p>
<p class="p1">“I’ll show you mine if you show me yours!” Intended for dance teachers of all levels. Discuss and display both modern secondary sources and various facsimiles (transcriptions, translations) of primary sources. (Thurs. 14, 5-6 p.m., AS I) Gregory Blount</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">English Country Dance 101</p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Fifteenth-Century Balli</p>
<p class="p1">An intensive look at mixed-tempo balli. Covers the four basic dance tempi (piva, quadernario, saltarello, bassadanza) as well as dancing one dance type to the other tempi, improvisation and ornamentation. About four balli will be taught. Beginners are welcome but may find the class progresses very fast. (Tues. 12, 11 a.m.-1 p.m., Barn) Mistress Rosina del Bosco Chiaro</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Improvisation in Italian Dance</p>
<p class="p1">Covers a few 15th- and 16th-century Italian dances; looks at improvisation techniques and clues in the dance for use in improvisation. (Fri. 15, 9-10 a.m., Barn) Master Delbert von Strassburg</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The Inns of Court Dances</p>
<p class="p1">Dances that have their origins in manuscripts which survive from the Inns of Court (which housed lawyers and those studying law). Much of the reconstruction of these Almans and Pavans comes from Master Trahaern ap Ieuan and Mistress Jane Lynn of Fenmere. For any skill level. (Sat. 16, Noon-1 p.m., Barn) HL William Redcape of Iron Mountain</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Intermediate English Country Dance</p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Measures for Everybody</p>
<p class="p1">A few of the Old Measures (choreographed couple dances) of Renaissance England with an introduction to the basic steps of measures. (Sun. 10, 1-2 p.m., Barn) Lord Henry of Maldon</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Negri’s Canary from Hell</p>
<p class="p1">Negri’s Il Canario is one of the most complex Renaissance dances. This is an introduction to the dance form and this particular version. (Sat. 16, 11 a.m.-noon, Barn) Master Delbert von Strassburg</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Non-Playford English Country Dances</p>
<p class="p1">Country dances from MS Sloane 3858, including alternate forms of dances which also appear in “The English Dancing Master” by John Playford. (Mon. 11, 9-10 a.m., Barn) Lord Henry of Maldon</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Piva</p>
<p class="p1">Considered “bumpkinish” by the 15th century, fit only for peasants, yet done at parties when everyone was well “pickled.” Will teach the basic piva and three dances which use the piva step (Petit Riens, Amoroso, Belfiore). For all levels of experience. (Mon. 11, 11 a.m.-noon, Barn) Mistress Rosina del Bosco Chiaro</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Two Dances from Negri</p>
<p class="p1">These are two of the more simple dances from Negri’s “Le Gratie d’Amore”. While Negri generally has the more complex dances of the period repertoire, these are a good introduction to his steps and style. (Mon. 11, Noon-1 p.m., Barn) Master Delbert von Strassburg</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Quadernaria</p>
<p class="p1">Fifteenth-century Italian dances which remain entirely in 4/4 time (like most English country dances). Will teach the steps needed as well as three dances from the following: Anello, Gelosia, Rosina, Vita di Cholino. For all skill levels. (Mon. 11, 3-4 p.m., Barn) Mistress Rosina del Bosco Chiaro</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">An SCA-Choreographed Dance. The dance, “Corwyn’s Folly”, was created in the style of a Scottish<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>country dance. It is of an intermediate level and requires an even number of lords and ladies. (Sun. 10, 2-3 p.m., Barn) Mistress Amber</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Square Sets for 8 from Playford</p>
<p class="p1">Different square dances from the 1651 edition of Playford. Dances may include Hyde Park, If All the World Were Paper, Mage on a Cree, Fain I Would if I Could. For all skill levels. (However, “Fain” is challenging!) (Sun. 10, 11 a.m.-noon, Barn) Lord Antoine de Bayonne</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Teaching Techniques for Dancemasters</p>
<p class="p1">Ideas for teaching dance more effectively in the SCA. If you would like to introduce harder dances to your group, displace out-of-period dances with reconstructions, or increase attendance at your dance practices, I have some ideas. (Wed. 13, 10:30 a.m.-noon, Barn) Mistress Mara Kolarova</p>
