	<title>Pennsic Dance: Classes </title>

<body>
<h2>"What sorts of class proposals are you looking for? </h2>
<ul>

<h3>Schedule to be done on May 1st, until then here are the kinds of classes for which I'm looking:</h3>
    <li> Classes on all sorts of pre-17th century and SCA-compatible
    English Country dances, the more variety the better! There should be a
    good mix of easy dances and advanced dances, since dancers of all
    skill levels attend. If you would like to do a focused-beginner class
    for a specific dance genre, or an absolute beginner class, please
    contact the Dance Coordinator directly. Last year there was a
    children's dance class that was a big success, and we would like to
    have more this year. </li>

    <li> Classes on the popular favorites that are done often at Pennsic, and also new dances that have not been taught at Pennsic. </li> 
    <li> Classes on dance movement and style rather than  
    dance choreographies. The period sources described how to be a graceful  
    dancer, and classes on this topic have been a success in years past. </li>
    <li> Classes on reconstructing dances from the period sources, and ones that go into the history of dance. </li>
</ul> 
Now, what would you like to do?

	<li><a href="regteacherlist.php">See Currently Registered Teachers</a> </li>
	<li><a href="RegisterClass.php">Class Registry</a><br>
	Note: the current way to change a class is to resubmit it and let us know which to use.
