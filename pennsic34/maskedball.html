<title>Pennsic Dance: The Masked Ball </title>

Unto the most noble subjects of the eighteen kingdoms do I, Judith de
Northumbria, honourable ladye of the court of Drachenwald, recommend me.

<p>This year, the good Don Lyev has given me to the enjoyable task of
coordination for the Grand Ball that will take place in the fair city of
Pennsic this summer.  Herewith I am providing a <a href="#balllist">tentative list of dances</a>
for the ball. As I ardently desire that the festivities find favour with
all particpants, I invite all potential participants to make suggestions
for the Ball's Play List.  As time will be somewhat limited, I will be
unable to honour all requests, but I will endeavor to arrange an evening
enjoyable to all. 

<p>For our dancing pleasure, the most noble Meastro Octavio
de Flores will be leading the best musicians in the eighteen kingdoms, that
our step may never lose its rhythm; the muses of dance and music are, after 
all, the closest of sisters. 


<p>Any questions can be directed to the following location: <a href="mailto:judithsca_at_aol_dot_com?subject=[PennsicDanceWeb]Ball Questions">judithsca_at_aol_dot_com</a>.
(make sure you change the _at_ and _dot_ when you send mail)

<p>I remain your loyal servant,  
<br>Judith de Northumbria, etc.

<a name = "whatball"><li>  What is the Pennsic Ball? Is it a masked ball, do I need to have a mask? </a>
<ul>If you wish to wear a mask, please do so -- many dancers show up in masks. 
But you don't need one. It is a large dance gathering that draws over 200 
people. Please see <a href="maskedball.html#letter">THL Judith's above letter</a> for more information. </ul>
