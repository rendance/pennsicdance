<a name="wheredance"><li>Where is it? </a>
<ul>During the daytime and evenings, we yet again have the use 
of a dance tent with a feet-friendly wooden floor. There is either open 
dancing or dance parties in the evenings. All are welcome to the parties, 
so bring a friend! Sometimes there are games and refreshments at the 
parties, for those that just want to do the period practice of schmoozing 
with friends and watching the revels. The tent is at the southeast end of 
the A&S area. Floor assembly is on the first Wednesday Aug 10 at noon 
(since evening dancing starts that night!), and disassembly is after 
classes on the final Friday Aug 21. All help and especially power drills 
and screwdrivers are very much appreciated! For evening dance at other 
times and for post-midnight open dancing, we are in the barn. The full 
schedule is on the webpage and onsite booklet. 
</ul>

<a name="whendance"><li>  When is it? </a>
<ul>Classes are 10am-5pm Thurs Aug 13 thru Fri Aug 21 (see 
webpage). Absolute beginner's classes and Ball-Prep classes are at 4pm, and 
focused introductory classes are at 3pm. The Pennsic Ball is tentatively on 
the second Tuesday in the barn starting 30 minutes after AEthelmearc court 
ends (probably 9ish or so). Evening dance starts at 9pm sharp, and runs 
until about midnight. Many of the easier dances or dances taught earlier in the  
day done in the first hour, so if you are a beginner, you may want to show  
up right when it starts!
 Any dancers who wish are welcome to dance in the barn past midnight. </ul>


<a name="teachdance"><li>  Will the dances be taught?</a>
<ul> During evening dancing, a variety of dances 
will be done. Some will have a walk-through for the dancers, some will just 
have a quick talk-through (to remind dancers who might need a refresher), 
and the more elaborate dances won't be taught at all. During the balls, 
including the Pennsic Ball, almost no dances will be taught. But the dances 
that are likely to be on the schedules are taught either in the beginner's 
classes or others during the day. </ul>

<a name="partnerdance"><li>  Do I need to bring a partner? </a>
<ul>
No, there are plenty of dancers each evening who would enjoy sharing a dance with someone new, so don't be shy.  In period, both men and women were expected to ask people to dance. So this  year try and ask someone you've never danced with! 
</ul>

<a name="musicdance"><li>  I'm a musician interested in playing for dance -- can I get the music set to me? </a>
<ul>For musicians interested in playing for evening dance or the Pennsic 
Ball, please contact the Musican Coordinator, Master Octavio de Flores, for 
advance copies of the music. Though we encourage period instruments, there 
is a place for everyone that plays.  We will host an orientation session 
for new musicians; check the class schedule.  For information, contact 
Master Octavio, mka: Jay Ter Louw, 3305 Vassar Court, Tallahassee, FL
