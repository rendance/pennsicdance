Everything you ever wanted to know about
<h1 align="center">The Pennsic 42 School of (European) Dance</h1>
and then some.
</center>
<p>

Welcome!
<P>

Unto the dance community of Pennsic does THL Margherita Battistina
send warmest greetings! It is with great honor that I lead the Pennsic
School of European Dance this year.
<P>
Dance is a skill and activity that has long played an important role
in Western society, having been used for exercise, as a prescription
for various ailments, by political leaders to convey messages to their
guests, and as a display of health, vigor, prestige, marriageability,
artistism and wealth.  This year, we are celebrating how dance fits is
part of the bigger picture, both historically and in our Society.
<P>
From the first Tuesday through the second Thursday, there will be
daytime classes covering all genres of dance and designed for dancers
of all experience levels.  In the evenings, we will offer dancing by
request during the first week, and a series of balls that will offer
something different and celebrate a different kingdom each night of
the second week.
<P>

We encourage all to attend this event.  Light refreshments will be provided and a group picture of all willing staff and teachers will be taken.
