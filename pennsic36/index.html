<h2>Welcome!</h2>

Unto the fair lords and ladies of the kingdoms, noble cousins all, I
recommend me, Judith de Northumbria, subject of the schwarzdrachen
throne of Drachenwald.  May this missive find you hail and may it find
your feet willing, for I write to you to speak of that most enjoyable
of pastimes, the art of Terpsichore herself - dance.  This year, I
have the honour and joy to lead western dance at the annual gathering
of the kingdoms at the town of Pennsic, and I hope that all will join
me in teaching, learning, and revelling!  As in previous years, our
Dance Pavillion with its beautiful floor stands at the ready to
welcome all comers in the ancient pleasure of dance; we will be
offering a full slate of classes for all levels of skill and
experience; and, of course, we will have the Grand Ball, among other
smaller, themed revels.  I warmly invite you all to join us,
especially those who have never danced before, for in dance, more is
always merrier!<p>

<h2>Grand Ball Dance List (Tuesday, August 7)</h2>

<blockquote>
May it be known that this year, at the grand assembly which shall occur
Tuesday, August 7, in
the town of Pennsic, there will be a magnificent Ball.  It has been deemed
that this fete will harken back to the days of our forefathers who founded
the magnificence of Athens and Rome.  Thus are all noble and gentle people
invited to attend adorned in classical costume, whether that be mythical or
historical, in order to enhance the atmosphere that we wish to create.

<h2>16th Century Revel (Monday, August 6)</h2>

Greetings to all dancers of the Known World! I,
Vyncent atte Wodegate, am pleased to bring you this
news: On the evening of the feast of the
Transfiguration of Our Lord (the 6th of August) at the
Pennsic War, a revel will be held celebrating all
manner of dance, be they put down on paper by the
Frenchman Thoinot Arbeau, our good friend Signor
Fabritio Caroso, the esteemed Signor Cesare Negri, or
the dances that they call in England The Old Measures.
<p>

From the hour of nine until midnight, the tent shall
be full of wonderful music, delights to enjoy on the
banqueting table, and gracious lords and ladies to
dance with.  I have also recently received word that,
by special arrangement, the group of noted musicians,
Istanpitta, will be playing the music for the revel.
It will prove quite an evening!
<p>

As ever, I remain,
<p>

Vyncent atte Wodegate
<p>

Note: 16th Century dress admired, not required.
Istanpitta will be performing all of the music for the
evening, and you are welcome to make any requests of
them that you might fancy, either in between sets or
at the end of the revel.

<h2>15th Century Revel (Thursday, August 9)</h2>

       May it be known that I will host a revel on the feast of
St. Amour (August 9th), and that this revel will be rather wanton in
nature, indulging in drink, food, music--- and that path into the
bowels of Hell itself, dance!  Festvities will commence after the
setting of the sun, at the ninth hour of the clock; all are invited to
come and make merry, no matter their pleasure!  For those who follow
the path of Terpsichore, I have contracted a fine ensemble of pipers
who will obey any request provided that it be concurrent with
contemporary tastes in these time of the Medici and the ascendancy of
the great house of Burgundy.
<p>

I remain your servant,<br>
Judith, etc.
<p>



Notice!
<p>

The theme of the food, dancing and music will be 15th century, but
that does not preclude people who have no 15th c. clothing from
attending--- ALL are welcome, whether they dance, drink or do anything
15th century or not...Vikings, Romans, Arabs, Magyars, Franks,
everyone! Please, pass this invitation on to all and sundry.  It is a
party, first and foremost!
