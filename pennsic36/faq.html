<h1>Common Questions About Pennsic Dance</h1>
</center>

<h2>Where is it?</h2>

During the daytime and evenings, we yet again have the use of a dance
pavillionwith a feet-friendly wooden floor. There is either open
dancing or themed dance parties in the evenings. All are welcome to
the parties, so bring a friend!  Sometimes there are games and
refreshments at the parties, for those that just want to do the period
practice of schmoozing with friends and watching the revels.<p>

For evening dance at other times and for post-midnight open dancing,
we are in the barn. The full schedule will appear in the onsite
booklet (and on this webpage in the near future).<p>

The dance tent is at the southeast end of the A&amp;S area. Floor assembly
is on the first Wednesday (Aug 1) at noon (since evening dancing
starts that night!), and disassembly is after classes on the final
Friday (Aug 10). All help and especially power drills and screwdrivers
are very much appreciated!<p>

<h2>Will the dances be taught?</h2>

During evening dancing, a variety of dances will be done. Some will
have a walk-through for the dancers, some will just have a quick
talk-through (to remind dancers who might need a refresher), and the
more elaborate dances won't be taught at all. During the balls,
including the Pennsic Ball, almost no dances will be taught. But the
dances that are likely to be on the schedules are taught either in the
beginner's classes or in other classes during the day.

<h2>When is it?</h2>

Classes are 10 am - 6 pm, starting Land Grab Thursday, and ending War
Week Friday. Absolute beginner's classes and Ball-prep classes are at
4pm, and focused beginner classes, which are themed to a specific
historical period and region, take place at 3pm.<p>

Evening dance starts at 9pm sharp, and runs until about midnight. Any
dancers who wish are welcome to dance in the barn past midnight.<p>

The date for the Grand Pennsic Ball is as of yet unsettled.  As
further information becomes available, it will be posted.<p>

<h2>What is the Pennsic Ball? Is it a masked ball, do I need to have a mask?</h2>

It is a large dance gathering that draws over 200 people.  If you wish
to wear a mask, please do so - many dancers show up in masks. But you
don't need one.<p>

<h2>Do I need to bring a partner?</h2>

No, there are plenty of dancers each evening who would enjoy sharing a
dance with someone new, so don't be shy. In period, both men and women
were expected to ask people to dance. So this year try and ask someone
you've never danced with!<p>

<h2>I'm a musician interested in playing for dance - can I get the music sent to me?</h2>

For musicians interested in playing for evening dance or the Pennsic
Ball, please contact the Musican Coordinator, Master Octavio de
Flores, for advance copies of the music. Though we encourage period
instruments, there is a place for everyone that plays. We will host an
orientation session for new musicians; check the class schedule. For
information, contact Master Octavio, mka: Jay Ter louw,

or via e-mail,
