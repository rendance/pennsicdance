<h1>A Summary of Dancing at Pennsic 31</h1>

As usual, we had nightly dancing in the Barn, and a Masked Ball, this
year on Tuesday evening of war week.<p>

All classes were held in the dance tent on our wonderful plywood
floor, which also was used for hosting 2 evening parties (an English
Revel on Sunday, and a pre-1600 party on Thursday), and 2 Caroso
balls. Classes included a second beginner track, this one with 1 style
of dance per day. There were 4 pre-ball preparation classes, 2 hours
each. The <a href="pennsic31classes.html">full classlist</a> is online.<p>

One of the two Caroso Balls was a Real Caroso Ball, the first one that
I've ever heard of. It was reasonably fun but not great, with the main
lesson learned being that we need to work harder to make sure that
reconstructed dances have freely-copyable sheet music.<p>

Dance music was not mailed out in advance this year.<p>
